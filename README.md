MVP:
1. User Registration and Login: Users should be able to create an account, log in, and manage their accounts.
2. Mailbox Management: Users should be able to own mailboxes and manage their mailbox(es) â€“ this includes viewing, sorting, and deleting emails.
3. Sending Messages: Users should be able to send messages (email or text) to their list of customers. This is the main function of your app, so it needs to be in the MVP.
4. Notifications: Notify users when they have a new message or when a message they've sent has been read.
5. Basic Search and Filter: Users should be able to search their inbox and filter messages based on some basic parameters like date and sender.
6. Basic Spam Protection: Implement a simple spam filtering system to keep user inboxes clean and safe.
